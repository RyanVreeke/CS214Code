# Begun by: Prof. Adams, for CS 214 at Calvin College.

#
# Input:  The start, stop and increment values
# Precondition: The start value is less than the stop value, 
#     and the increment is greater than 0
# Output: A table of logarithms from start to stop, with increment
#     as the step value

Example1:
1) I see different cases that seem to take into account whether or not the text entered
into the program matches any of the designated commands and if so it takes that into 
account using a new buffer.

Example2: 
1) When you input an underscore the program just echo's it back
while still recognizing whether or not the other inputed values
are a NUMBER or WORD. An example is the input 5_jab where the 
result would be NUMBER_WORD.

Example3:
WORKED

Example4:
1) A terminal is denoted using All-Caps while a non-terminal is in All-lowercase.
2) It is strange that the temperature controller can't determine if the heat is on / off
or what the temperature is set to.

Example5:
WORKED

Example6:
